# Image Build Specification of Alibaba Cloud Container Service for Kubernetes (ACK) 

Notes: The template [ack-centos.json](https://github.com/AliyunContainerService/ack-image-builder/blob/master/ack-centos.json) is used for building custom image for ACK cluster based on the latest published ecs centos public image.

This repository contains resources and configuration scripts for building a custom base OS Image for ACK with [HashiCorp Packer](https://www.packer.io/).

## Supported OS

* CentOS 7.6/7.7/7.8/7.9
* Aliyun Linux 2 (Alibaba Cloud Linux 2)

## Setup

You must have [Packer](https://www.packer.io/) installed on your local system. For more information, see [Installing Packer](https://www.packer.io/docs/install/index.html) in the Packer documentation. You must also have Alibaba Cloud account credentials configured so that Packer can make calls to Alibaba Cloud API operations on your behalf.

For more information, see [Alibaba Cloud builder](https://www.packer.io/docs/builders/alicloud-ecs.html) in the Packer documentation.

## Building the OS Image

Execute following scripts in your shell

```
export ALICLOUD_REGION=XXX
export ALICLOUD_ACCESS_KEY=XXX
export ALICLOUD_SECRET_KEY=XXX
packer build examples/ack-aliyunlinux2.json
```

## Build ACK-Optimized-OS image

Execute following scripts in your shell

```
export RUNTIME=XXX
export ALICLOUD_REGION=XXX
export ALICLOUD_ACCESS_KEY=XXX
export ALICLOUD_SECRET_KEY=XXX
packer build examples/ack-optimized-os-1.20.json
```
NOTE: `RUNTIME` only support `docker` and `containerd`


## RAM Policy

If you are using a sub accountï¼Œthe ram policy should at least include actions as below:

> Note that you'd better release the delete permissions once you have completed your image build task for safety reasons.
